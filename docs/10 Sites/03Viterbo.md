# Field Sites - **Viterbo (Italy)**

## Introduction to the Landfill site

* The [Landfill](https://maps.app.goo.gl/pFBqV8zs9PugMF599) site is located about 10 km to the NorthWest of the town of Viterbo in Italy.
* The study site is about 0.2 km<sup>2</sup>.


## Geological and Hydrogeological General Framework  

The Quaternary eruptions of Latium Region are related to the post-collisional volcanism of the eastern Tyrrhenian border. This potassic-alkaline volcanism developed during the Quaternary period along the Tyrrhenian margin of Italy, from the northern Vulsini District to the southern Vesuvio-Phlegrean Fields’ volcanic structures. The area of southern Tuscany and Latium has been affected since the Plio-Pleistocene period by intense magmatic activity, with a migration in time and space of the feeding fissures from west to east, and important changes in the nature of the erupted magma. 

The Pliocene magmatic activity began along the Tyrrhenian border, with emplacement of intrusive bodies and extrusions of crustal anatectic magmas. During the Pleistocene period some volcanic acid products of Tuscan affinity, as well as products with Lamproitic affinity, were erupted (1.3 – 0.9 Ma). The Cimini Volcanic District was formed during 1.35 – 0.95 Ma (Nicoletti, 1969), whereas the products of the three main volcanic districts, Vulsini, Vico and Sabatini, were erupted between 0.6 and 0.1 Ma. The volcanic rocks of these districts display a broad compositional spectrum with magmas belonging to the two distinct evolutionary series, called the potassic and high potassic series (Peccerillo & Manetti, 1985). According to Beccaluva et al., 1991, the volcanism in the Roman Comagmatic Province can be related to the partial melting of heterogeneously-enriched mantle sources. Serri et al., 1993 suggest that mantle sources of the northern Apennine arc’s magmatism can be explained by a geodynamic process which causes a large amount of heterogeneous crustal material to be incorporated within the upper mantle.

Different aquifer systems can be distinguished in relation to the type of volcano, hydrostratigraphy and volcano-tectonic setting. These factors control the boundaries and characteristics of flow in each aquifer system. Table 1 summarizes the primary information regarding the volcanoes’ hydrogeology from the available literature.

*Table 1: Summary of the main hydrogeological features for the volcanic aquifers*

| System | Surface Area (km²) | Bottom Boundary | Lateral Boundaries | Aquifer Type | Discharge | Recharge |
|--------|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Vulsini | 1733 | Generally close: low-permeability sedimentary units | Open and close: sedimentary units and alluvial deposits | Basal aquifer generally unconfined, few perched aquifers | Streams, rivers, basal and perched springs, surrounding aquifers and lake | Mainly by direct infiltration |
| Cimino-Vico-Sabatini | 2800 | Close and open: low-permeability sedimentary units sometimes fractured and faulted | Open and close: sedimentary units, and alluvial and coastal deposits | Basal aquifer generally unconfined, several perched aquifers | Streams, basal and perched springs, surrounding aquifers and lakes | Mainly by direct infiltration |
| Albani Hills | 1982 | Generally close: low-permeability sedimentary units | Open and close: sedimentary units and alluvial deposits | Unconfined or leaky basal aquifer, several perched aquifers | Streams, rivers, basal and perched springs, surrounding aquifers and lake | Mainly by direct infiltration |


The bottom boundaries of the systems depend on the relative permeability of the substratum compared with that of the volcanites and on the occurrence of volcano-tectonic structures that can interrupt the continuity of the low-permeability substratum, allowing interactions with deep aquifers. Based on these general concepts, open and close bottom boundaries can be distinguished for the different aquifer systems in relation to the possibility of the uprising of fluids from deep aquifers toward the more active groundwater circulation hosted in the volcanites within the first hundreds of meters and recharged from direct precipitation (Table 1).

The variability in the erupted products affects the hydraulic heterogeneity of the aquifer systems, originating a complex subdivision of groundwater circulation in polygenetic volcanoes, where explosive phases frequently alternate with effusive eruptions (for example, Cimino-Vico-Sabatini system). Continuous, generally unconfined basal aquifers have been found with a potentiometric surface controlled by the topography and/or surface morphology of the substratum of the volcanics. Where there is a frequent vertical variation of relative permeability, several perched aquifers of limited discontinuous extent or overlapped aquifers have been found (Table 1).

The volcanic aquifers discharge mainly into the streams and rivers and secondarily into the springs. Numerous springs are related to the perched aquifers and generally discharge less than 10 l/s, characterizing systems with a more fractioned groundwater circulation. Exchanges between the surface water of the volcanic lakes and the groundwater of the basal aquifers have been found with flow from the aquifer toward the lakes and viceversa. The present knowledge regarding the groundwater resources of the volcanic aquifers is based on water budget estimations. Table 2 summarizes the available estimates for each volcanic aquifer.

The waters of the basal and perched aquifers are generally characterized by low temperature and salinity, and they show different hydrochemical facies according to the different rock chemistry and mineralogy. 
In the volcanic areas, mineral and thermal waters discharge from springs and wells related to deeper circuits located near more recent volcano-tectonic structures or where hydrostratigraphy permits the uprising of waters circulating in deep aquifers below the volcanites. These waters are characterized by high temperature and salinity, hydrochemical facies ranging from bicarbonate to sulfate to chloride, and high gas content (mainly CO2). 
A relation among regional fractures and the concentration of fluoride and arsenic in groundwater in this area is widely described (Baiocchi et al., 2013). Due to the interaction of overlapping aquifers and to water rock interaction with igneous minerals, groundwaters are naturally contaminated by toxic elements such as arsenic and fluoride with values often higher than the standards set for the human consumption by the European Directive 98/83/EC (Parrone et al., 2013). Nevertheless, the regional aquifer hosted in the volcanic formations (alkaline-earth bicarbonate and alkaline bicarbonate type) is largely used for human consumption as well as for irrigation.


## Vulsini Volcanic District  

The Vulsini Volcanic District, located south of the Siena-Radicofani graben and west of the Tiber River (Figure 2), was active between 600 ka and 100 ka. Its products extend over an area of approximately 2200 km2, distributed radially from the tectonic volcano depression occupied by Lake Bolsena (G Nappi et al., 2004). 
From a geodynamic point of view, the volcanic complex is connected to the post-Miocene extensional tectonics, which followed the compressional phase responsible for the formation of the Apennine chain.

## The Landfill Site  

The landfill plant is located about 10 km from Viterbo, at an approximate altitude of 220 m above sea level, on the southern side of the Vulsino apparatus. The site is inside the watershed of the Marta River, the only emissary of Lake Bolsena, whose estuary is located on the Lazio coast near the Tarquinia plain. The watershed covers a total area of approximately 1071.2 km<sup>2</sup>, including the lake of Bolsena of approximately 114 km<sup>2</sup>.

“Le Fornaci” landfill covers a total area of approximately 50 hectares and is divided into three pits, two of which have been exhausted and one is exploited since 2009. The first pit, located north of the site, is divided into two sublots for a total volume of about 373,000 m<sup>3</sup>. The second one, located at the center and toward the south of the site, has a total volume of about 1,370,000 m<sup>3</sup>. Finally, the third operational pit has a volume of 850,000 m<sup>3</sup>.

### Hydrogeological framework

The plant was built in correspondence of volcanic deposits belonging to the Vulsino Volcanic district, at a short distance from the limits of the Vicano Volcanic apparatus. In particular, it is located in correspondence of a broad lava flow (Commenda Lavas) with SW-NE orientation. 
As part of the construction of the monitoring piezometers, geognostic surveys were carried out; this allowed the detailed reconstruction of the lithostratigraphic structure of the study area. Lithological descriptions indicate the nature of the soils, the depth, the thickness of the individual lithotypes and the level of the aquifer. 

Le Fornaci site falls into the Marta River basin and the runoff direction is SSW oriented. From a hydrogeological point of view, the aquifer in the study area develops within the volcanic deposits, which show medium to high degrees of permeability of both primary type (porosity) and secondary type (fracture), this last dominant in lava flows. The bottom of this aquifer Is represented by low permeability sedimentary deposits constituted mainly by marls and clays and which represent a regional aquiclude. Literature data indicate a direction of groundwater flow at the regional scale in accordance with the hydrography, that is oriented mainly towards the South. The hydrogeological units present in the area can be summarized as follows:

1. **Travertines complex – medium to high aquifer potential**: ancient, recent and current travertines, travertine concretions intercalated with alluvial and lacustrine deposits (Pleistocene-Holocene) with variable thickness up to a maximum of a hundred metres. Where it emerges in large, isolated plates it is the site of significant water circulation which gives rise to local aquifers of good productivity; where it is in hydraulic continuity with the regional alluvial and/or carbonate aquifers, the productivity of the aquifer increases because it is well fed

2. **Lavas, laccoliths, and scoria cones complex – medium to high aquifer potential**: generally welded scoria, lavas and laccoliths (Pleistocene). The thicknesses range from a few dozen to a few hundred meters. This complex contains aquifers with local importance and high productivity, but with a limited extension. 

3. **Stratified tuffs and phreatomagmatic facies complex – low aquifer potential**: stratified tuffs, earthy tuffs, pyroclastic breccias, pumices, lapilli and lava blocks in a cineritic matrix (Pleistocene). The formations of the complex are interdigitated among the other volcanic complexes, making difficult to define their total thickness. The complex has a limited hydrogeological relevance although locally can affect groundwater circulation assuming the role of flow limit, also sustaining small shallow aquifers.

4. **Marly-clayey flysch complex – very low aquifer potential**: generally chaotic successions of clays and marls with intercalations of sandstones and marly limestones (upp. Cretaceous – Oligocene). Variable thicknesses up to over 1000 m. The complex does not have significant groundwater circulation.


The hydrogeological characterization of the outcropping rocks enabled to group the different formations into hydrogeological complexes. The main characteristics of the hydrogeological complexes recognized are given in Table 3. On the basis of this analysis, it concludes that the aquifer is constituted by the volcanic complexes, i.e., the lavas, pyroclastic and unconsolidated pyroclastic complexes. As a matter of fact, the volcanic and volcanoclastic rocks are characterized by high relative permeability, a significant thickness (generally from some meters to some tens of meters) and a more extensive outcropping in the area, occupying about 73% of the total basin area. These hydrogeological complexes of Pleistocene age are overlapped to Plio-Pleistocene and Cretaceous-Miocene sedimentary rocks grouped in the clayey-sandy-conglomeratic and marly-calcareous-arenaceous complexes (Figure 10). These latter two complexes are characterized by low relative permeability and define the lower limit of the volcanic aquifer. In the study area, the low permeable basement outcrops on the southern edge of the basin and in the central part (Figure 5) affecting the groundwater flow modalities of volcanic aquifer.

The conceptual hydrogeological model has been reconstructed through the data concerning the wells and springs located in the basin and in its neighbourhood, the head of the water level of the gaining streams detected during the streamflow measurements and considering the limits of the low-permeable complexes.
Using the data, it was possible to reconstruct the aquifer’s potentiometric surface which can be considered a mean surface on the piezometric levels of the period 1987-2004. It has chosen the contour level separation (50 m) in such a way to reduce the effects of the seasonal variations of piezometric level (generally less than few meters).

The reconstructed potentiometric surface, shown in Figure 5, highlights a radial convergent flow oriented towards the low course of the River Marta and River Traponzo. The groundwater divide does not always follow the watershed, in particular the hydrogeological basin is wider (about 645 km<sup>2</sup>) than the drainage basin (about 578 km<sup>2</sup>). Northwards the hydrogeological basin is open to groundwater inflow from the lake along a section of about 10 km, being the piezometric head lower than the lake level. Along the north-eastern margin the groundwater divide is controlled by a local piezometric high, circumscribed with the contour line of 300 m asl.
In this area the potentiometric morphology can be interpreted as being due to the deep groundwater rise which feeds partly the volcanic aquifer and partly the thermal springs of Viterbo (Piscopo et al., 2006).
The spacing of the piezometric contour lines show that the hydraulic gradient is higher in the north-eastern and eastern sectors (from 0.06 to 0.04) than in the southern part of the basin. It is probably due to the highest transmissivity of this last sector of the aquifer. There is checking of this hypothesis for the area bordered by Viterbo, Vetralla and streams Leia and Biedano (Baiocchi et al., 2006). For the area around Tuscania it must be borne in mind that the well yield is between 4 and 7 l/s, whereas most of the wells do not exceed 2 l/s.
Regarding the relationship between groundwater and streams, the potentiometric surface shows a convergent flow towards the low course of the river Marta and its tributaries (Leia, Biedano and Traponzo streams). These branches of hydrographic network are the main discharge of the volcanic aquifer, according to the high flow rate increments measured in the streams during the investigation (overall 1.8, 4.5 and 2.5 m3/s in May 2004, March 2005 and May 2005) and the reduced flow rate of the examined springs (on the whole about 0.3 m<sup>3</sup>/s). 
The reconstructed potentiometric surface has been compared with that quoted from Capelli et al. (2005) which used piezometric data referred to a homogeneous period of time (2002-2003). The comparison showed that the differences between the two reconstructions were minor except for the eastern (around Viterbo) and north-western sectors (around Valentano) where there are some differences in the piezometric contour lines. The potentiometric surface reported in Capelli et al., (2005) also highlights a hydrogeological basin wider than the drainage basin; the difference of the surface area between the two hydrogeological basins is less than 20 km<sup>2</sup> considering the same river section.
